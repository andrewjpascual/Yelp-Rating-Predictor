# Yelp-Rating-Predictor
I gathered three to five businesses with at least twenty reviews and then used these businesses with different neural network implementations in TensorFlow to predict the star rating. Once I got the best network implementation, I used the model to grab the respected names and compare it to their actual ratings.
   
## Why did you build this?
This was my very first implementation with machine learning in Python and I was tasked with constructing machine learning models by tuning the hyperparameters around various activations, number of layers, neuron counts for each layer, and optimizations.

## What did you learn from this?
With this being my first practice of machine learning and data analysis, I learned how to extract a dataset, figuring out how to change models and use them, implementing EarlyStopping, and using RMSE to compare models.
